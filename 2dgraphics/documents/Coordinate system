Graphics

The graphics operators used in PDF content streams describe the appearance of pages that
are to be reproduced on a raster output device.The graphics operators from six main groups:

1. Graphics state operators
   Graphics state operators manipulate the data structure called the graphics state.
   Graphics state is the "global framework" within which the other graphics opertors execute.
   
   Graphics state includes:
   1. Current transformation matrix(CTM)
   2. Current color(Color Space)
   3. Current clipping path
   
2. Graphic object
   Graphic object contains operators operands
   Graphic object types:
   
   A path object: begin with m,re  end with f,s
   A test object: ---   
   An external object:---
   An inline image object:---
   A shading object:---

3. Graphic State

Clipping path          Entire imageable page         a path construction begin with re end with W and n
color space(CS)            Device Grey               a name
color                      black                     numbers
text                       ----                      contain 9 graphic statement parameters
line width	            1                        thichness
line cap	            0                        shape endpoints for any open path
line join                   0                        shape of joints
miter limit
dash pattern              a solid line
stroke adjustment         false                      compensate for possible rasterization effects

1.Coordinate System

Coordinate systems define the canvas on which all painting occures. They determine the position, 
orientation, and size of the text, graphics, and images that appear on a page. 

A coordinate space is determined by te following properties with respect to the current page:
  The location of the origin
  The orientation of the x and y axes
  The lengths of the units along each axis

Transformations among coordinate spaces are defined by transformation matrices, which can specify any 
linear mapping of two-dimensional coordinates, including translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, and skewing.
