Note of how pdf draw a basic graphic

Path Construction and Painting
1. Paths defines shapes, trajectories, and regions of all sorts.
2. Paths specify boundaries for clipping other graphics.

Comment: Processes of how pdf draw graphics is similar with how people draw. That is, by using a pen to construct
a continuous path. When ending a subpath, another subpath starts at the end of previous subpath. How to definite
connection between paths?

Connection
1. A pair of segements are said to connect only if they are defined consecutively->end point of one seement is 
anothe segement start point.(Nonconsecutive segements that meet or intersect ortuitously are not considered to 
connect)
2. A path is made up of one or more disconnected subpaths, each comprising a sequece of connected segements.

Representing format
1. A path object is defined by a sequence of operators to construct the patth, followed by one or more oprators
to paint th path or use as a clipping boundary.

PDF path operators fall into three categories:
1.Path construction operators: deine th geometry of a path. A path is constructed by sequentially applying one 
or more of these operators.
2.Path-painting oprators end a path, object, usually causing the object to be painted on the current page in any 
of a variety of ways.
