alternatives by addressing several technical challenges 
-- “ll factor/quantum ef“ciency (QE), global shutter 
ef“ciency (GSE), and dark current. In overcoming these 
challenges, CMOS image sensor vendors are delivering 
global shutter pixel technology with smaller pixel size, 
larger “ll factor, higher GSE, lower dark current ,and lower 
noise, better positioning CMOS image sensors to replace 
CCD at an accelerating rate. 
Rolling Shutter Overview
Also known as focal-plane shutter, a rolling shutter 
utilizes two scans … reset and readout … to control the 
exposure time. A shutter pulse that resets a row scans 
the pixel array prior to readout scanning (Figure 1). The 
interval between the shutter and the readout pulses 
determines the exposure time. However, since exposure 
times of different rows are shifted when a rolling shutter 
sensor is used, still images of fast-moving objects become 
distorted, rendering the rolling shutter unsuitable for 
applications like barcode scanning, machine vision, or 
automated inspection systems, which require the imaging 
of rapidly moving objects.

To conform to early TV system architectures and other 
mediums that transmitted data serially, the earliest 
image sensing technology utilized an electronic shutter 
mechanism known as a rolling shutter. With this long 
history, the rolling shutter and its associated column-
parallel readout architectures, in which pixels of the same 
row are readout simultaneously, was also the natural 
choice for performing shutter operations within CMOS 
image sensors.
The global shutter pixel technology typically found on 
charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors can offer 
signi“cant bene“ts such as the elimination of rolling 
shutter artifacts through simultaneous image capture of 
the entire frame. However, the use of global shutter pixel 
requires the addition of a pixel-level memory … one of the 
barriers to widespread global shutter adoption.
As CMOS image sensors have grown in popularity and as 
machine vision, movie production, industrial, automotive, 
and scanning applications increasingly place high priority 
on the ability to capture fast-moving objects with high 
image quality, image sensor vendors have worked to solve 
the technical challenges involved with the utilization of 
global shutter pixel technology on CMOS image sensors

machine vision, scanning, and the “lming of movies like

possible. Further, with 
signi“cant CMOS processing technology advancements, 
transistors can be made much smaller;  this, together with 
improved micro-lens technology, is better enabling image 
sensor vendors to cost-effectively integrate the memory 
required for a global shutter.
Today, CMOS image sensor providers are closing the 
performance gap between rolling and global shutter
